== PFTT - the Practically-Formulated-Test-Tool ==

PFTT is a BSD-licensed automated testing framework for PHP, built to systematically identify bugs in 
complex PHP installations. Its components are responsible for installing PHP in various configurations, 
setting up complex filesystem scenarios, and running tests in every possible combination of the various 
factors with which it is configured. 

PFTT is a network based testing system, following a Client (Controller) and Host Topology. 
The Client controls multiple hosts where the actual testing occurs. 
A PFTT server coordinates multiple clients access to hosts. 
Manual loading of PHP binaries and tests is done on the client or server, and PFTT will distribute it to Hosts.


=== Network System Topology ===
*  host - runs the tests received by client
*  server - coordinates access to host pools and shares tests, binaries and configurations with clients 
*  client - runs the tests on hosts

---

:  may combine client+host (ie run tests on localhost). may do client+localhost and other hosts and optionally a server
:  may have client(s) and host(s) without a server
:  may only have one server
