<h1>Application Testing for Posix &amp; Windows platforms</h1>

<h1>Posix</h1>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>There are so many Linux distributions with so many versions, its really more sensible to test with these core distributions and with major versions of the components your application depends upon. Those will vary, but may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Glibc</li>
<li>KDE Gnome</li>
<li>QT GTK</li>
<li>Phonon ESD Artsd Enlightenment SDL OSS Alsa</li>
<li>X.org XV X11 XVMC</li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging Systems</h3>

<p>You should test on these core distributions, each of which have a different system for packaging software (which you'll need to configure your software for, and which you should also test).</p>

<h1>Windows</h1>

<p>Unlike Linux, Windows bundles all those components together(by Windows and component version), which makes test planning simpler. But, that means that you need to test across many versions of Windows. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, <i>testing many Windows versions can get expensive</i>, so I've broken down the Windows versions to focus on depending on the type of application and how thorough you want to be.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> None of this information official Microsoft information. Rather this is based on my experiences in Posix]+Windows  interoperability (also Older-Windows + Newer-Windows).</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><center>Key</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Minimum</strong></td>
<td>Before you can say your software works on Windows you should test on each of these. If you don't test on a Windows or Windows Server version, you should NOT say it works on that version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Client-Minimum</strong></td>
<td>For desktop applications, these are the Windows versions you should focus on. If possible, you should also test it on versions of Windows Server just in case some of your users use it on those.</td>
<tr>
<td><strong>Multimedia</strong></td>
<td>Multimedia applications may behave differently on x86 and x64. Also, you should also test your application on each Windows Server edition (2003|2003r2, 2008, 2008r2) because audio and video software(ex: VoIP Phone client) may behave differently on them (due to driver differences and security features).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Server-Minimum</strong></td>
<td>For Server software (ex: a web server), these are the Windows versions you should focus on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Recommended</strong></td>
<td>For any software you want to run on Windows, you should really test on these versions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Thorough</strong></td>
<td>To be through, to be really sure it'll work, test on these.</td>
</tr>

<p><b>Note:</b> run 'Winver' (type into Start/Run or Start/Search) to tell which Windows version is running.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> I use SP0 to refer to the RTM release, the very first release/version (simpler to use one notation for the service pack, the standard SPn notation).</p>

<p>You should test x86 code on x64 also, because Windows x64 uses an extra subsystem(Wow64) to support x86 which will at least, add a performance penalty to your application (though x64 CPUs tend to be more powerful than x86 which can compensate).</p>
<p><b>Before</b> you can really say your software works on an OS, you <b>need</b> to have tested it on at least the minimum service pack(s) of that OS. It sounds obvious, but many companies don't do it. </p>
<p>If you're going to say '<i>It works on Windows</i>' that <b>includes Windows XP</b>. You'll need to test on Windows XP(above). To avoid that, you should instead say '<i>It works on Windows Vista|2008 and newer</i>'.</p>
