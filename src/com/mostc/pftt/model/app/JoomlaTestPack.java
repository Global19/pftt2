/** Pack of Joomla Platform's PHPUnit Tests.
 * 
 * The Joomla project is divided into Joomla Platform and Joomla CMS. Joomla CMS is based on Joomla Platform and is what people
 * are actually refering to when they just say 'Joomla'. Joomla CMS provides few/if any useful php unit tests, so we'll just use the Joomla
 * Platform's PHP Unit tests (other web applications can be based on Joomla Platform, its a framework).
